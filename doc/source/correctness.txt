Kernel Correctness Verification
-------------------------------

Whenever you optimize a program for performance it is very important to
ensure that the program is still producing the correct output. What good
is a program that is fast but not correct?

Therefore an important feature of the kernel tuner is to verify the output
of every kernel instance in the parameter space. To use the kernel tuner
with correctness checking you need to pass the ``answer`` option to
``tune_kernel()``. Answer is a list that should match the order and types of
the kernel arguments. However, if an argument to the kernel is input-only
you may insert ``None`` at that location in the list.

After kernel compilation, but before benchmarking the kernel, the kernel
tuner runs the kernel once to verify the output it produces. For each
argument in the ``answer`` list that is not None, it will check the results
produced by the current kernel against the expected result specified in
``answer``. The comparison is currently implemented using numpy.allclose()
with an maximum allowed absolute error of 1e-6. 

At this moment, there is no way to modify the error tolerance or way the
results are compared by the kernel tuner, if you are interested being able
to control this, please notify the kernel tuner developers.

The example in ``examples/cuda/convolution_correct.py`` demonstrates how
to use the ``answer`` option of ``tune_kernel()``:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy
    import kernel_tuner

    with open('convolution.cu', 'r') as f:
        kernel_string = f.read()

    problem_size = (4096, 4096)
    size = numpy.prod(problem_size)
    input_size = ((problem_size[0]+16) * (problem_size[1]+16))

    output = numpy.zeros(size).astype(numpy.float32)
    input = numpy.random.randn(input_size).astype(numpy.float32)

    filter = numpy.random.randn(17*17).astype(numpy.float32)
    cmem_args= {'d_filter': filter }

    args = [output, input, filter]
    tune_params = dict()
    tune_params["block_size_x"] = [16*i for i in range(1,9)]
    tune_params["block_size_y"] = [2**i for i in range(6)]

    tune_params["tile_size_x"] = [2**i for i in range(3)]
    tune_params["tile_size_y"] = [2**i for i in range(3)]

    grid_div_x = ["block_size_x", "tile_size_x"]
    grid_div_y = ["block_size_y", "tile_size_y"]

    #compute the answer using a naive kernel
    params = { "block_size_x": 16, "block_size_y": 16 }
    results = kernel_tuner.run_kernel("convolution_naive", kernel_string,
        problem_size, args, params,
        grid_div_y=["block_size_y"], grid_div_x=["block_size_x"])

    #set non-output fields to None
    answer = [results[0], None, None]

    #start kernel tuning with correctness verification
    kernel_tuner.tune_kernel("convolution_kernel", kernel_string,
        problem_size, args, tune_params,
        grid_div_y=grid_div_y, grid_div_x=grid_div_x,
        verbose=True, cmem_args=cmem_args, answer=answer)

This example uses the ``run_kernel()`` function of the kernel tuner 
to run a single kernel and return its results, with almost the same
interface as ``tune_kernel()``. In this example we run a naive CUDA
kernel whose results are trusted to be correct.

The ``answer`` list is constructed out of the results from the naive
kernel, but only includes the kernel arguments that are actually outputs.
The arguments that are input are replaced by a ``None`` value in the
``answer`` list before the list is passed to ``tune_kernel()``.
