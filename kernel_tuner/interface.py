            of the first item in the list of filenames. The purpose of this

            The Kernel Tuner will try to compile and benchmark all possible
            combinations of all possible values for all tuning parameters.
            This typically results in a rather large search space of all
            possible kernel configurations.

            For each kernel configuration, each tuning parameter is
            replaced at compile-time with its current value.
            Currently, the Kernel Tuner uses the convention that the following
